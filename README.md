- 👋 Hi, I’m Richard but everyone calls me by my middle name Matt.  I have about 10 years experience in Social Services and the nursing profession.  I also served a 6 year stint in the army.  While walking to my car one day I ended up slipping on some ice and broke my ankles.  I taught myself python, HTML, and CSS during this time because honestly I was literally stuck in front of a computer with nothing else to do for three months.  Taking an interest in the subject I graduated from App Academy's bootcamp and found a valuable tool to continue my passion in life.    
- 👀 My passion is helping people.  Technology can be utilized in this regard.  Its a tool that can be used for mass government surveillence, however, it also can be used to help deliver food for homeless families.  Like the internal combustion engine or nuclear power its a tool that can be utilized to improve and transform our society.                
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring the concept of human computer interaction.  In many cases programs are not written from the users perspective.  
 This causes tech poor / time crunched nurses to commit medication errors. It also prevents individuals from successfully 
 navigating the procedures necessary to access social services / charitable assistance.  Even in the aftermath of COVID many individuals 
 still struggle with basic computer literacy.  We need to cater more to these individuals and assist when possible.  Everything from the user interface all the way to the backend needs to be designed for someone who is not as comfortable with technology as we are.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to assist where needed on a version of indeed / career builder that caters to recently returned citizens.  It would have a better impact on reducing recidivism than an additional five billion dollars spent on law enforcement.  I currently manage a website based on the concept of mutual aid.  This enables people 
  to seek help for various projects and help in return either the individual or "pay it forward" to someone else.  Sort of a way to directly help people instead of donating money via gofundme.
